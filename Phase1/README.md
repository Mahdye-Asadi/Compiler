For the provided code the input will be a file, named "input.txt" in pascal language and the output will be a file, named "output.txt" that show the tokens.

## Structure

In the code we provided reserved words, tokens, regular expressions, functions that define some rule for recognizing tokens and a dictionary called "symbol table" to keep track of identifiers and their corresponding row numbers. 

P.S : The reason for separating reserved words and tokens is that it makes compiler works faster.
